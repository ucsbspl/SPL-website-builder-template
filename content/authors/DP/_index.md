Diego is interested in investigating the biological underpinnings of social behavior. He uses an interdisciplinary approach (e.g., social psychology, clinical and affective neuroscience, behavioral neuroscience) to investigate intergroup processes and their relation to brain function and mental health. Currently, he is investigating the impacts of intergroup conflict (e.g., stigma, bigotry, racism) on reward processing.
